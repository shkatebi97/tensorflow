Inference timings in us: Init: 259428, First inference: 65617, Warmup (avg): 62819, Inference (avg): 60422.2
Note: as the benchmark tool itself affects memory footprint, the following is only APPROXIMATE to the actual memory footprint of the model at runtime. Take the information at your discretion.
Memory footprint delta from the start of the tool (MB): init=20.2422 overall=20.2422
